# Work Day Scheduler
A simple calendar for the day

## Description

There is always a need to stay organized in life.  The motivation to create this project was to help keep the day organized, hour by hour, in a clear and easy manner.  As a student, time management is a valuable skill and this scheduler is just one more tool to help with that.

Through beginning with a basic HTML and powering it through the use of jquery and third party APIs, I learned quite a bit.  I learned more about utilizing third-party APIs and how to create a dynamic HTML through these options.  I also learned more about local storage, how to store and how to recall this information.  Implementing jquery will be an extremely useful tool moving forward.

## Technology

This application was created with HTML, CSS, Moment.js and Jquery.

## Usage

The user will deploy the site: https://rachlally.github.io/work-day-scheduler/ 

Upon arrival to the Work Day Scheduler, the user will be greeted with the day of the week, current date, and current time.  They can scroll through the work day hours, beginning at 9AM and ending at 5PM.  To add a reminder, event, or task the user may click in the text box next to the hour of event.  They can type in desired text and click the save button at the end of the row.  Their input will be saved in local storage and rendered to the page whenever refreshed throughout the day.  Another helpful feature is the color coding reflecting if an event has past (grey), is happening (red), or will happen in the future (green).
